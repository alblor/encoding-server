## Overview

This project was born out of necessity, as a way to deploy a secure and private encoding server to untrusted environments: I have a lot of old media of my family, pictures and videos, VHS digitalized media, that need a lot of resources to be encoded entirely, yet I don't want to leak my personal information to the public.

It can be a very interesting Homelab project, and I hope other devs will be willing to improve it and extend the functionality.

The encoding server runs on a minimal and efficient Docker container, making it more versatile and robust, and despite its simplicity has some very effective enterprise grade security features, using a dual-mode encryption approach that provides complete transparency to end users while maintaining zero-trust security principles.

## Key Features

### üîê **Dual-Mode Encryption Architecture**
- **Automated Mode**: Users interact exclusively with unencrypted media while server transparently handles all cryptographic operations
- **Manual Mode**: Client-controlled encryption where the user provides the already encrypted file securely to the server (useful on compromised clients)
- **Batch Processing**: Fully fledged folder encryption/decryption with recursive processing and integrity verification

### üõ°Ô∏è **Enterprise Grade Security**
- **HTTPS-Only Operation**: Complete TLS certificate lifecycle management
- **2024-2025 Threat Protection**: Enhanced Seccomp profiles protecting against IO_URING vulnerabilities, container escapes, and process injection attacks
- **Layered Container Security**: Advanced AppArmor + Seccomp + Linux capability restrictions (NOTE: If deploying in another container like LXC, it is suggested to let the outer container manage AppArmor)
- **Docker Secrets Integration**: Zero hardcoded secrets with centralized SecretManager system
- **Password Security**: Complete elimination of password exposure with encrypted Redis storage

### üèóÔ∏è **Proxmox-Native Architecture**
- **Docker-in-LXC Deployment**: Simple single container approach that is designed to work out of the box on Proxmox LXCs
- **Alpine Linux Base**: Minimal attack surface with maximum security hardening
- **ZFS Integration**: Native encryption support for temporary processing
- **Resource Optimization**: 48GB RAM, 8+ cores recommended for optimal performance

### ‚ö° **High-Performance Processing**
- **21 API Endpoints**: 12 processing + 9 comprehensive documentation endpoints
- **Real-Time Progress Monitoring**: Frame-level accuracy FFmpeg tracking
- **Comprehensive Job Management**: Full lifecycle control including graceful cancellation
- **Redis-Based Queue**: Distributed job coordination with session state persistence

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Proxmox VE 8.0+ (for production deployment)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for development)
- Python 3.11+
- 48GB RAM and 8+ CPU cores (recommended)

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd encoding-server

# Start secure environment
make secure-build && make secure-up

# Run comprehensive tests
make test-all

# Access API documentation
curl https://localhost:8443/v1/docs
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Build and deploy with Docker-in-LXC
make secure-build
make secure-up
```

The MakeFile architecture is centralized and can be used as a control panel to run tests, deploy and stop the container. Is it meant for those who are not practical with Docker containers.

### Docker Compose Configuration

The `docker-compose.secure.yml` file can be adapted to your specific needs:

```yaml
# Key configuration areas to customize:
environment:
  - LOG_LEVEL=INFO          # Change to DEBUG for development
  - MAX_WORKERS=4           # Adjust based on CPU cores
  - MAX_FILE_SIZE=2GB       # Set upload limits
  - SESSION_TIMEOUT=3600    # API session timeout

volumes:
  - ./uploads:/app/uploads          # Custom upload directory
  - ./results:/app/results          # Custom output directory
  - ./certificates:/app/certs       # TLS certificate location

ports:
  - "8443:8443"            # HTTPS port (change external port as needed)
```

## Quick Start Examples

### Basic File Processing
```bash
# Submit a video for encoding (automated mode)
curl -X POST https://localhost:8443/v1/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@video.mp4" \
  -F "params=-c:v libx264 -crf 23"

# Check job status
curl https://localhost:8443/v1/jobs/{job_id}

# Download result
curl https://localhost:8443/v1/jobs/{job_id}/result -o encoded_video.mp4
```

### Using Client Tools
```bash
# Manual mode: encrypt first, then submit
python client-tools/encrypt_media.py input.mp4 encrypted.enc
curl -X POST https://localhost:8443/v1/jobs \
  -F "file=@encrypted.enc" \
  -F "mode=manual" \
  -F "params=-c:v libx265 -crf 28"

# Batch processing entire directories
python client-tools/batch_encrypt.py /path/to/media/folder
```
